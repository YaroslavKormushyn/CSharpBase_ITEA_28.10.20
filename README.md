# CSharpBase_ITEA_28.10.20

This is a repository dedicated to Group 8 of ITEA Base C# course homework submission.

## If you are a student of group 8

Homework submission process:

1. To submit your homework create a branch for it first

2. Branch should be named properly: incorporate your name and module name (can be shortened) for clarity

3. You commit your work directly only to your branch. You can do any work on that branch for the module.

4. After finishing work on your homework submit a PR to the `main` branch.

5. The PR will be reviewed by the teacher. The review can have two outcomes:
   1. Approval - you did everything perfectly and your work can be merged to `main`

   2. Change request - teacher found some inconsistencies and problems in your code which you may address and resolve by pushing a fix with a commit to your branch. After you commit the teacher will review those changes (back to step 5). Note: commits after the deadline will be ignored.
6. When you have your PR approved you should merge your changes to the `main` branch and delete your branch from the repository.
