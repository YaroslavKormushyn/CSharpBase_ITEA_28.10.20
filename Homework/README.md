# Homework folder

Here you're going to upload your homework programs.

Each module has its own folder. 

Each module folder will have a folder for each student, where you will upload your programs.

Folder structure will look like this:

```
+-- README.md (this file)
+-- Conditional expressions + Loops
|   +-- Student1 (your name here)
||      +-- Program1 (name of the program)
|   +-- Student2
|   +-- ...
+-- Methods + Collections
|   +-- Student1 (your name here)
|   +-- ...
```
